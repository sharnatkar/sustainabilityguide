        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>We're three young professionals looking for ways to live a more sustainable lifestyle.
            We believe you can improve the choices you make to help take care of the environment
            without compromising your lifestyle. We've picked areas such as food and fashion to look 
            at because these are areas where sustainable choices are becoming more and more apparent. 
            This website helps create a directory of brands and restaurants you can visit to shop and 
            eat without feeling guilty about the environmental impact. </p>
